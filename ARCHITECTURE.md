# Classgrid Platform Architecture

## Deployment Stack
- **Frontend (`client/`)**: Hosted on **Vercel**. Vercel automatically builds and deploys the frontend on push to the `main` branch.
- **Backend (`server/`)**: Hosted on an **AWS EC2 instance (t3.medium)** serving `api.classgrid.in`. 

## Domain Architecture (Security & Compliance)
The platform is decoupled into three strict domain zones to ensure security and pass stringent Payment Gateway (Razorpay) compliance reviews:
1. **`classgrid.in` (Marketing Site)**: A public brochure/marketing website. No application logic or sensitive data is hosted here.
2. **`[school-name].classgrid.in` (The Product)**: The core SaaS ERP. Every onboarded institution receives a secure, isolated subdomain. This is a closed system requiring strict authentication (like a dashboard).
3. **`billing.classgrid.in` (Payment Microservice)**: A completely decoupled, isolated React portal. When an admin needs to pay their subscription invoice, they are securely redirected here with OTP verification.

## Payment & Billing Flows
Classgrid facilitates two distinct financial flows via Razorpay:

### A. B2B Flow (SaaS Subscriptions - 3-Layer Billing)
Institutions are billed monthly dynamically based on consumption. There are no fixed annual fees.
- **Layer 1 (Base Platform Fee)**: Fixed monthly maintenance cost.
- **Layer 2 (Add-on Modules)**: Institutions toggle features ON/OFF (e.g., Canteen, Admissions) and are billed only for active modules.
- **Layer 3 (Infrastructure Usage)**: Micro-billing via backend Node.js cron workers for: Cloudflare R2 (GB/day), AWS SES (emails), SNS (SMS), API requests, AI tokens (OpenAI/Groq/Gemini), and Agora live class participant-minutes.
- **Invoice Generation**: `pdf-invoice.service.js` uses Puppeteer (headless Chrome) to render the usage ledger into a high-fidelity PDF invoice.

### B. B2C/B2B2C Flow (Institution Fee Collection)
For student fee payments (tuition, exams, etc.), Classgrid uses an RBI-licensed Payment Aggregator's Sub-Merchant API.
- Institutions are onboarded as sub-merchants.
- Student payments are settled directly to the institution's bank account via the PA's escrow.
- Classgrid acts purely as a technology routing layer and never holds institutional funds.

## AI Agent Instructions
**CRITICAL**: DO NOT attempt to run `npm run build` or `vite build` inside the `client/` folder on the EC2 server. The EC2 instance has limited RAM and running the frontend build will cause a memory exhaustion crash (OOM killer). The EC2 instance is exclusively used for running the PM2 Node.js backend server.
