# The Master Admin Onboarding Flow (FINAL)

Person first. Organization second. Completely separated.

---

## Phase 1: Personal Setup (The Human)

### Step 1: Welcome & Identity
- Show "Welcome to Onboarding!"
- Admin confirms/enters their **Full Name**.
- Show: "Welcome, Classgrid Admin [Name]!"

### Step 2: Personal Contact & OTP
- **Email:** Enter/confirm personal email → verify.
- **Phone:** Enter personal phone number → verify via **OTP** (AWS SNS).

### Step 3: Profile Photo
- Upload personal profile photo (dashboard avatar).

### Step 4: Personal Details + @Username
- **Date of Birth**, **Gender**, **Nationality**.
- **Designation/Title** (Principal, Director, Owner — cosmetic only, backend stays `org_admin`).
- **Preferred language**, **Timezone**.
- **@username** setup:
  - A unique handle like `@nikhil` or `@rahul_sharma`.
  - Must be unique across the **entire platform**.
  - Auto-suggest based on their name (e.g., name "Nikhil Shinde" → suggest `@nikhil_shinde`).
  - Saved to **both** the `User` model (new `username` field) AND the `forumusers` MongoDB collection.
  - This way the **same @username** works in Chat mentions AND the Discourse Forum.
- **Alternate phone/email** (optional).
- **Personal Address** (optional).

### Step 5: Security (Password)
- Set up their secure login password.
- *(Personal Setup Done!)*

## Phase 2: Organization Setup (The School/Institute)

### Step 6: Platform Terminology & Hierarchy (Visual)
- Show a **visual flow diagram** (inspired by the ChatGPT image) — NOT a table.
- Only show the terms for **their specific org type** (School, Coaching, or Junior College).
- Example for School: Visual flow → `Standard → Class → Section → Students → Teacher → Test`
- Each node has a small description (e.g., "Standard — Overall grade level like 1st, 2nd, 3rd").
- Also show "Other Academic Components" like **Term** and **Homework**.
- Side panel: "What these mean?" with brief definitions.
- Note: "You can customize these terms later from Settings."

### Step 7: Organization Identity & URL
- Upload **Organization Logo**.
- Set the **Custom Portal URL** (e.g., `myschool.classgrid.in`).
  - Auto-suggest available URL based on Org Name.
  - Show available options (one org can't have duplicate).

### Step 8: Organization Details (Auto-Fetched from Demo)
- **Organization Name** (pre-filled from Book a Demo lead).
- **Organization Type** (School / Coaching Institute).
- **Organization Address, City / State / PIN** (pre-filled from Demo, editable).
- **Academic year / session**.
- **Board / curriculum** — CBSE, ICSE, State Board, etc. (from `full_erp_data.json`).
- **Affiliation / registration number** (optional).
- **Organization short name / code**.
- **Default currency**, **Timezone**, **Working days / weekly calendar**.
- **Website URL** (optional, pre-filled from Demo if available).

### Step 9: Organization Official Contact & OTP
- Enter the school's **Official Phone** and **Official Email**.
- Both verified via **OTP** (AWS SNS for phone, AWS SES for email).

## End: Thanks & Welcome
- "Thank you! Your workspace is ready."
- Click to enter the live dashboard.

---

> **Note:** Basic Academic Structure (Classes, Sections, Departments) is **NOT** part of this onboarding. That will be a separate setup flow inside the dashboard.
