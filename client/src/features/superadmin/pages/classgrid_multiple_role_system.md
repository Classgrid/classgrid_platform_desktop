# Classgrid — Multiple Role System (Complete Reference)

> **Purpose:** This document explains the complete multiple role system in Classgrid.
> Every AI session working on this codebase MUST read this first before touching anything related to roles, dashboards, onboarding, or access control.

---

## What Is the Multiple Role System?

Every person in Classgrid has **ONE main role** when their account is created. This is stored in `user.role` in the database.

They can request **ONE additional role** at any time. This is stored in `user.additional_roles[]` (array, max 1 item).

**Maximum 2 roles per person. No more. Ever.**

There are **NO restrictions** on which role they pick as additional. A principal can also be a teacher. A fee manager can also be an admission counselor. Anyone can combine any 2 roles from their org's available list.

---

## The Rules (Enforced by Backend)

1. **Max 2 roles** — `user.role` (1) + `user.additional_roles[]` (max length 1)
2. **No duplicates** — cannot request a role you already have
3. **System roles cannot be requested** — `org_admin`, `super_admin`, `student` are assigned by the system only
4. **Role must exist in your org type** — cannot request `tpo_officer` if you are in a School
5. **Tenant ID must match your org** — security check

**Backend file:** `server/src/utils/multipleRoles.js`
**Function:** `canUserRequestRole(user, requestedRole, org)` — call this before accepting any role request

## The 10 Dashboards (Fixed Forever)

| # | Dashboard Key | Frontend Path | Roles That Land Here |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `student` | `/student/work` | `student` |
| 2 | `faculty` | `/work` | `faculty`, `counselor` |
| 3 | `org_admin` | `/org/admin/dashboard` | `org_admin`, `principal`, `vice_principal`, `hod`, `coordinator`, `tpo_officer` |
| 4 | `admissions` | `/dept/admissions/dashboard` | `admission_head`, `admission_counselor`, `admission_verifier`, `admission_clerk` |
| 5 | `examination` | `/dept/exams/dashboard` | `exam_controller` |
| 6 | `fees` | `/dept/fees/dashboard` | `fee_manager` |
| 7 | `library` | `/dept/library/dashboard` | `library_manager`, `library_admin` |
| 8 | `hostel_transport` | `/dept/transport/dashboard` | `transport_manager`, `hostel_manager` |
| 9 | `hr_payroll` | `/dept/hr/dashboard` | `hr_admin` |
| 10 | `attendance` | `/dept/attendance/dashboard` | `attendance_admin` |

**The sidebar items inside each dashboard can be shown/hidden per role later. But there will always be exactly 10 dashboards. Never more.**

---

## How the Dashboard Switcher Works

- Main role → determines which dashboard they land on after login
- If additional role maps to a **different dashboard** → **header switcher dropdown appears**
- If additional role maps to the **same dashboard** → **no switcher** (more access inside that dashboard)
- Chat, profile, notifications are always the same regardless of which dashboard

**Examples:**
- `principal` + `faculty` → SWITCHER (org_admin dashboard ↔ faculty dashboard)
- `admission_head` + `admission_clerk` → NO SWITCHER (both → admissions dashboard)
- `fee_manager` + `hr_admin` → SWITCHER (fees dashboard ↔ hr dashboard)
