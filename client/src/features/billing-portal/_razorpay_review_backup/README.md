# ⚠️ Razorpay Review Backup — DO NOT DELETE

These files are the **Razorpay merchant verification versions** of the billing portal pages.
They were built specifically to pass Razorpay's 5-round manual review process.

## What is in here

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CheckoutPage.RAZORPAY_REVIEW.tsx` | Full checkout page WITH `IS_DEMO = true`, Name + Email input fields (required by Razorpay review team to test the flow manually) |
| `BillingLandingPage.RAZORPAY_REVIEW.tsx` | Full landing page WITH `DemoCard` (amber test card with fake credentials), "Platform Purpose & Operational Flow" popup modal, test credentials (OTP: 123456, Card: 4111..., UPI: success@razorpay) |

## When to restore these

If Razorpay asks for re-verification (e.g., when enabling E-Mandate, UPI AutoPay, or if account is under review):

1. Copy these files back to `../pages/`
2. Rename them (remove `.RAZORPAY_REVIEW` suffix)
3. Set `IS_DEMO = true` and `DEMO_ENABLED = true`
4. Deploy to billing.classgrid.in
5. Submit the review URL to Razorpay support

## What was removed from production

- `IS_DEMO = true` flag → name/email input fields on checkout (not needed — org admin billing details already saved in DB from their billing settings page)
- `DEMO_ENABLED = true` flag → entire DemoCard with fake test credentials
- "Platform Purpose & Operational Flow" popup modal (built to explain business model to Razorpay reviewers after 5 rejections)

## The REAL production flow (no demo stuff needed)

Org Admin (inside school dashboard) → Clicks "Pay Now" on invoice
→ Token generated → Redirect to billing.classgrid.in/checkout?token=xxx  
→ OTP sent to their saved billing email (from DB)
→ They enter OTP → Razorpay checkout opens with DB-prefilled details
→ Pay → Done
