# Classgrid Platform — STRICT 1:1 BACKEND → FRONTEND AUDIT

**Date:** September 1, 2026
**Target:** `C:\CLASSGRIDPLATFORM\classgrid_platoform-desktop-`
**Specification:** `docs/all_dashboard_wireframes.md.resolved`

## METHODOLOGY
This audit utilizes a **Strict 1:1 Feature Mapping**. 
For every backend feature, field, or API endpoint that exists, the frontend must have a fully working, integrated implementation to receive completion credit. Dashboards that render visually but rely on static/mock data (e.g., `const data = [...]`) or call hallucinated API endpoints are scored at **0% functional completion** for those features.

## 1. Dashboard Completion Breakdown

| Area | Backend Features/Fields | Fully Working Frontend | Completion |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| **Dashboard 1 (Super Admin)** | 40 | 38 | **95%** |
| **Dashboard 2 (Org Admin)** | 45 | 40 | **88%** |
| **Dashboard 3 (Admissions)** | 35 | 28 | **80%** |
| **Dashboard 4 (Fees Dept)** | 16 | 0 | **0%** |
| **Dashboard 5 (Exam Dept)** | 32 | 0 | **0%** |
| **Dashboard 6 (Library Dept)** | 15 | 0 | **0%** |
| **Dashboard 7 (Attendance)** | 17 | 0 | **0%** |
| **Dashboard 8 (HR & Leave)** | 19 | 0 | **0%** |
| **Dashboard 9 (Hostel/Trans)** | 0 | 0 | **0%** |
| **Dashboard 10 (Faculty)** | 29 | 1 | **3%** |
| **Dashboard 11 (Student)** | 40 | 1 | **2.5%** |

## 2. Missing / Unimplemented Backend Features
*(These features exist in the backend Express routes/database, but have NO fully working frontend integration.)*

### 1. Fees Department (0/16 Frontend Integrations)
- `POST /structures`, `GET /structures`, `DELETE /structures/:id` (Fee structure management)
- `POST /assign`, `POST /pay` (Manual fee assignment and collection)
- `GET /payments`, `GET /analytics` (Payment tracking and reporting)
- `POST /razorpay/order`, `verify`, `webhook` (Payment gateway integration)
- *Note: `FeesDashboardPage.tsx` relies completely on static `txData` arrays.*

### 2. Examinations Department (0/32 Frontend Integrations)
- `GET /examinations/analytics` (Exam summary statistics)
- `GET /examinations/admin/all`, `POST /admin/create` (Exam lifecycle management)
- `POST /admin/:examId/timetable/upload` (Timetable parser via Groq AI)
- `GET /online-exam/...` (Online examination taking/grading endpoints)
- *Note: `ExamsDashboardPage.tsx` relies completely on static `examData` arrays.*

### 3. Library Department (0/15 Frontend Integrations)
- `GET /catalog`, `POST /books`, `POST /import` (Book inventory & AI categorization)
- `POST /issue`, `POST /return`, `GET /transactions` (Circulation desk operations)
- `POST /reserve`, `POST /fulfill-reservation` (Hold/Reservation queue system)

- `POST /:classroomId/bulk-override`, `POST /:classroomId/appeal`

- *Note: The frontend `useAttendance.ts` hook calls hallucinated/non-existent endpoints (e.g., `/api/attendance/dashboard/submit`) instead of the actual backend routes. This results in 0 functional completions.*

### 5. HR & Leave Department (0/19 Frontend Integrations)
- `POST /leave/request`, `POST /leave/quick` (Applying for leaves)
- `PUT /leave/:requestId/status` (Approving/Rejecting leaves)
