# Billing Demo Mode Cleanup Plan

Once Razorpay completes their architecture review and approves the flow, follow these steps to remove the demo mode so that `billing.classgrid.in` returns to production mode (only accessible via real dashboard links).

## Step 1: Disable Environment Variables (Fastest Method)
You do not need to delete any code immediately. Simply disable the feature flags in your Vercel dashboard.

**In Vercel (Client App):**
1. Go to your `classgrid-client` project settings > Environment Variables.
2. Change `VITE_BILLING_DEMO_MODE` to `false`.
3. Redeploy the client. The "Try Demo" card will disappear from the landing page.

**In Vercel (Server App):**
1. Go to your `classgrid-server` project settings > Environment Variables.
2. Change `BILLING_DEMO_ENABLED` to `false`.
3. Redeploy the server. The `/api/billing/demo/*` endpoints will return 403 Forbidden.

*Any active demo sessions will automatically expire based on their MongoDB TTL (48 hours).*

## Step 2: Code Cleanup (Optional, for clean codebase)
If you want to completely remove the demo code from the repository after approval:

### 1. Remove the Demo Route File
Delete `server/src/routes/billing-demo.routes.js`.

### 2. Remove the Route Registration
In `server/api/index.js`, remove:
```javascript
import billingDemoRoutes from "../src/routes/billing-demo.routes.js";
app.use("/api/billing/demo", billingDemoRoutes);
```

### 3. Clean up the Frontend
In `client/src/features/billing-portal/pages/BillingLandingPage.tsx`:
1. Delete the `DemoCard` component.
2. Delete `const DEMO_ENABLED = ...`.
3. Remove `{DEMO_ENABLED && <DemoCard />}` from the JSX.
4. Remove the `CopyButton` component.

### 4. Clean up Environment Variables
Remove `VITE_BILLING_DEMO_MODE` from `client/.env.local` and `BILLING_DEMO_ENABLED` from `server/.env`.
