# Classgrid - Backend-to-Frontend Audit Correction

**Audit date:** 2026-09-02  
**Scope:** static source inspection only: `server/src/routes`, `client/src`, and `docs/all_dashboard_wireframes.md.resolved`  
**Mode:** audit only; no application code changed.

## Important correction

The earlier report incorrectly labelled a **static API-path match** as **frontend completion**. That is wrong.

For example, the earlier **Admissions 84.2%** meant only this:

- 64 of 76 literal backend route-operation paths also occur somewhere in the client source.
- It does **not** mean 84.2% of the Admissions UI is visible, reachable, working, or end-to-end complete.
- It does **not** prove that an admissions user can open those pages, submit a form, receive persisted data, or see a successful response.

**Therefore: Admissions frontend completion is not 84.2%. This audit does not establish a runnable frontend-completion percentage for Admissions.**

## What the source actually contains for Admissions

- `client/src/app/router.tsx:334-354` declares 21 concrete `/dept/admissions/...` routes.
- `client/src/features/admissions/` contains page and API-client source files.
- The folder includes both real-query candidates (for example `AllApplicationsPage.tsx`) and static/example dashboard code (`AdmissionsDashboardPage.tsx` defines `applicationsData`).
- The client has a global type-check failure with 791 TypeScript error lines, including missing router imports. A source route is not proof that the running application can load it.
- No authenticated browser/API/database workflow was run in this audit. No live completion percentage may be inferred.

If the Admissions dashboard is not visible in the running application, that observation takes priority over the static route list: it is **not a working frontend feature** until the access path, build, and workflow are verified.

## Static route-path reference inventory - not completion scores

The following is retained only as a developer inventory. The rightmost percentage is **not a frontend percentage**, **not a backend percentage**, and **not an overall dashboard score**. It is merely the proportion of declared backend route-operation strings that have a matching client API-path string somewhere in source.

| Dashboard | Declared backend route-operation paths | Matching client API-path strings | Static path-reference rate - NOT completion |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 1. Super Admin | 76 | 59 | 77.6% |
| 2. Org Admin | 108 | 32 | 29.6% |
| 3. Admissions | 76 | 64 | 84.2% |
| 4. Fees | 22 | 0 | 0.0% |
| 5. Examinations | 86 | 10 | 11.6% |
| 6. Library | 38 | 0 | 0.0% |
| 7. Attendance | 35 | 7 | 20.0% |
| 8. HR & Leave | 13 | 1 | 7.7% |
| 9. Hostel & Transport | 0 | 0 | n/a |
| 10. Faculty | 73 | 27 | 37.0% |
| 11. Student | 110 | 26 | 23.6% |
| **Total** | **637** | **226** | **35.5%** |

## Scores this correction deliberately does not claim

- **Admissions frontend completion:** unverified; do not use 84.2%.
- **Total frontend completion:** unverified; 35.5% is not a frontend score.
- **Backend completion:** unverified by this quick path-reference scan; 637 route declarations do not prove business logic, persistence, validation, tenant isolation, or tests.
- **End-to-end integration completion:** unverified; no authenticated browser-to-database workflow was executed.

## Current evidence of incomplete/unverified operation

- `client/src/app/router.tsx:411` sends undeclared Admissions sub-routes to `GenericPage`, a placeholder.
- `client/src/features/admissions/pages/AdmissionsDashboardPage.tsx` contains a static `applicationsData` array.
- `client/src/features/admissions/pages/AllApplicationsPage.tsx` has query, search, filter, loading, error, empty, and pagination source code, but it still requires a compiling client, valid authenticated route, working API response, and database data before it can be scored as functional.
- The whole client type-check currently fails; therefore source presence cannot be promoted to a runnable claim.

## Required method for a real completion percentage

For every wireframe requirement, count it only after all of these are shown:

1. the user role can reach the exact page;
2. the required UI renders without placeholder/mock data;
3. the action calls the intended protected API;
4. the API validates, authorizes, and persists/returns the result; and
5. the frontend shows the returned result correctly.

Until this is verified, the honest status is **unverified**, not 84.2%.
